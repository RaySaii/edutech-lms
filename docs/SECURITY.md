## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Security
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15 minutes) for API access
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived (7 days) for token renewal
- **Token Storage**: Secure HTTP-only cookies recommended for web clients
- **Token Rotation**: Automatic rotation on refresh

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Hierarchical Roles**: Super Admin > Admin > Org Admin > Instructor > Student
- **Fine-grained Permissions**: Method and resource-level authorization
- **Organization Isolation**: Multi-tenant data segregation

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **TOTP Support**: Time-based One-Time Passwords
- **Backup Codes**: 10 single-use recovery codes
- **Enforcement Options**: Optional or mandatory per organization

### Password Security
- **Minimum Requirements**: 8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds (12 in production)
- **Password History**: Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout

## Production Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy .env.production.template to .env.production
cp .env.production.template .env.production

# Generate secure secrets
openssl rand -base64 64  # For JWT secrets
openssl rand -base64 32  # For encryption keys
```

### Critical Security Settings
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DB_SSL=true`
- `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=false`
- `REDIS_TLS=true`
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=true`

### Secrets Management
- Use AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or similar
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate secrets every 90 days
- Use different secrets per environment

## Security Headers & Middleware

### Helmet.js Configuration
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP rules
- **HSTS**: Enforce HTTPS with includeSubDomains
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff
- **Referrer Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Custom Security Headers
- `X-Request-ID`: Request tracking
- `Permissions-Policy`: Disable unnecessary browser APIs
- `X-EduTech-Version`: Application version (for debugging)

### CORS Configuration
```typescript
const corsConfig = {
  origin: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://app.yourdomain.com'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'HEAD', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'POST', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],
};
```

## Rate Limiting

### Endpoint-Specific Limits
- **Login**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Registration**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Global API**: 1000 requests per hour

### Implementation
- Redis-backed rate limiting
- IP-based tracking
- Progressive delays for repeated violations
- Whitelist support for trusted IPs

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- Database: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- File Storage: AES-256 encryption
- Backup Encryption: Separate encryption keys

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- mTLS for internal microservice communication
- Certificate pinning for critical endpoints

### Sensitive Data Handling
- PII encryption with separate keys
- Tokenization for payment data
- Secure deletion procedures
- Data retention policies

## Network Security

### Firewall Rules
```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
80/tcp   - HTTP (redirect to HTTPS)
443/tcp  - HTTPS
22/tcp   - SSH (restricted IPs)
5432/tcp - PostgreSQL (internal only)
6379/tcp - Redis (internal only)
5672/tcp - RabbitMQ (internal only)
```

### VPC Configuration
- Private subnets for database and cache
- Public subnets for load balancers only
- NAT gateways for outbound traffic
- Security groups with least privilege

### DDoS Protection
- CloudFlare or AWS Shield integration
- Rate limiting at multiple layers
- Geographic filtering if applicable
- Automated scaling for traffic spikes

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Configuration changes
- System access logs

### Log Management
- Centralized logging (ELK stack recommended)
- Log encryption and integrity protection
- Retention policy (minimum 1 year for security logs)
- Real-time alerting for security events

### Metrics & Alerts
- Failed login attempt spikes
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Error rate increases
- Performance degradation
- Certificate expiration warnings

## Deployment Security

### Container Security
```dockerfile
# Use minimal base images
FROM node:18-alpine

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Run as non-root
USER nextjs
```

### Kubernetes Security
```yaml
# Security context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
```

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for infrastructure
- Ansible for configuration management
- GitOps for deployment automation
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
